abstract: Fisheries stock assessments are typically performed for a single species or stock at a time. Not all stocks have the same available data (e.g. missing age structures), due to low fishing effort or sampling effort, so go un-assessed or get aggregated with other management units, despite heterogeneity in abundance or biological data. Modern hierarchical multi-species and multi-stock assessment models are an alternative option for dealing with data limitations in spatially diverse fisheries. For example, biological information can be shared between stocks within a species, and environmental effects may be experienced similarly by species that inhabit the same stock area. In this paper, we present a multi-species, multi-stock, age structured integrated assessment model, able to be fit to abundance, age, and length data for 5 flatfish species in 3 stock areas on the coast of British Columbia. For 2 species, at least one stock area is missing age composition data, so length compositions are the primary compositional data to detect changes in recruitment. To share information between stocks, hierarchical shrinkage priors are applied to catchability, stock-recruit steepness, survey index observation error variance,... parameters. We compare the assessment results under multiple model hypotheses and data scenarios. Integrated growth model/first assessments of many stocks/... Results...

# Introduction

Fisheries stock assessment is concerned with determining the status of exploited fish stocks under uncertainty [@hilborn1992quantitative]. Stock assessment models are fit to multiple sources of data, including abundance or biomass indices, age compositions, length composition data, and age-at-length data.

Fisheries management typically focuses on a single stock of a single species at a time. This narrow focus often implictly assumes that fish are uniformly distributed across the management area, ignoring any spatial structure, and ignores interactions between species, except implicitly through recruitment or mortality [@albertsen2017connecting; @siple2017contributions].

Data limitations - modern fisheries management is based on fitting age structured models, age data is often missing as it is costly to collect. Length compositions are 

Hierarchical multi-stock and multi-species stock assessment models offer an alternative to increasing costly age readings for low-abundance or importance stocks.
    - Sharing information [@johnson2018evaluating; punt2011among; @jiao2011poor]

In this paper, we apply a hierarchical multi-stock age-structured assessment model to a complex of 5 Pleuronectiforme flatfishes off the coast of British Columbia. 
    - DERPA
    - Different historic levels of exploitation/conservation concern
    - Multiple spatial scales?
    - Technical interactions - caught together (though not all)
    - estimating correlations in fishing/total mortality and recruitment (emmig/immig and technical interactions) - Read Siple paper again
    - Integrated growth model - look at integrated assessment model literature
    - shared priors on catchability [@johnson2018evaluating], steepness [@myers1999maximum], mortality [@albertsen2017connecting]


# Methods

## Study system

British Columbia's groundfish trawl fishery is one of 7 fisheries that operate on the BC coast. The entire groundfish fishery is managed using one integrated individual transferrable quota system, allowing transfers of quota allocations between licenses in different fleets. 

DERPA complex:
    - Dover sole, english sole, southern rock sole, petrale sole, and arrowtooth flounder.
    - All flatfish that are subject to managed/directed removals except Halibut, which are managed by the IPHC
    - History of DERPA??
    - DERPA is encountered mainly by the groundfish trawl fishery, with negligible removals from the other sectors/gear types
    - List assessments?

Not all stocks are surveyed equally: different stocks have large samples age structures, others have no samples at all. 
    - Length composition data supplement the age observations [@rudd2017accounting]
    - Integrated hierarchical growth model shares growth data between stocks and species [@cadigan2017hierarchical], allows for unbiased estimation of age/length observations - e.g. Random-at-length obs, conditioned on fleet selectivity and modeled age structure [@piner2016evaluation]
    - Can use hierarchical RAL growth model to extend growth hypotheses to stocks with missing data in a data-driven way (e.g. estimating a growth model for the stocks with missing age data), allowing for an age structured model for stocks with missing age data


## Data

- Relative biomass from fishery independent surveys (1984 - 2017) (Source)
- Fishery dependent CPUE (1956 - 2017) (Source)
- Age and length composition data (surveys and commercial fleet)
    * Explain stocks with missing data?
- Length-at-age data


## Stock assessment model

The stock assessment model has an age structured process model that explicitly includes uncertainty in the length-at-age distribution. Length-at-age distributions for each stock are estimated by fitting a hierarchical growth model to length and age data for each stock and species. 

**Equations are given in Table XX/Supplemental material**

For stocks without age observations, length comps with separate length-at-age distributions for each stock are used in the observation model. To avoid using the same data twice, we only use length compositions from individual fish where age was not observed. For fish where age was observed, accompanying length observations are available, and this data was used to fit the integrated Von Bertalanffy growth model

Hierarchical priors:
- integrated Schnute formulation of vonB growth model [@schnute1981versatile; @francis2016growth]
    - vonB K parameter between stocks
    - K, L2 and sigmaL within species
    - Random-at-length, using modeled age structure and selectivity inside the model
- Steepness between stocks and species (multilevel)
- Catchability for surveys
- M between stocks and species (multilevel)
- Correlations in recruitment deviations?
- Correlations in Ft deviations (auto-correlated Ft?)?
- Selectivity-at-length parameters - this will probably play well with the compositional data issues below

Multifleet model: one fleet for each survey leg in Synoptic (WCHG, HS, QCS, and WCVI), one for the HS Assemblage survey, and two commercial trawl fleets (historic and modern). Given the Synoptic survey is using the same vessel/gear across years and legs. These fleets naturally fall into three groups (Commercial Trawl, Assemblage survey, and Syboptic surveys), so a hierarchical prior





Compositional data: This might be the crux of this paper/analysis, i.e. what to do about compositional data 
+ what kind of likelihood to use? How to avoid swamping the abundance index likelihood?
+ What to do about selectivity - time-varying to follow bad fitting compositions?

## Model Hypotheses / Data scenarios

Here I need to include the data scenarios and model hypotheses I'm going to test. If I'm going to publish an assessment, then it needs to be a *thorough* assessment. So, what are our options:

1. Different hierarchical model structures
    a. Coastwide vs stock specific growth
    b. Different correlation matrix structures for (i) Recruitment process errors and (ii) Ft values - post-hoc analysis of correlations?
    c. Smaller or larger hyperprior variance on shared mortality/steepness priors
3. Multi-species vs single species/multi-stock
4. Data scenarios:
    a. Starting in 1956, 1984, 1996, 2003
    b. Age only, length only [No growth model], age/length?
5. Discarding? Contact Bruce Turris or Greg Workman about a grading length


## Optimisation and inference

- Integrated over random effects
- Bayesian or RE?

## Model selection criteria

AIC is standard, but need to calculate eff. number of parameters, and what about for choosing between two different data scenarios, e.g. coastwide vs multi-stock, different initial times? Cross validation??

## Reference points/management quantities



# Results

We found that
  - describe stock status of each species, indicate those that are in poor states/good states compared to their reference points.
  - Compare dover sole to @johnson2018evaluating, other species to other previous assessments

Different data scenarios showed that:
  - Adding length comps (reduced/increased) uncertainty for stocks with no age comps




 
# Discussion

In this paper we fit a hierarchical age-structured stock assessment to 5 species of flatfish, each with 3 stocks.

Challenges:
  - Fitting to length comps (you better get the biology right (ref))
  - overwhelming the likelihood with compositional data
  - integrating growth vs leaving it out

Limitations:
  - No movement
  - No technical/trophic interactions (bycatch ratios??)
  - 

Conclusion:
  - Despite limitations, these hierarchical stock assessment models are aviable method of extending assessments to management units where data are limited or non-existent
  - 

Future work: 
    - using this as an operating model to test multi-speces management objectives - could use simpler AM, such as multispecies coastwide.
    - Adding movement hypotheses
    - Adding bycatch - especially for testing above multi-species management objectives, want to have choke effects as an emergent property
